## Projects

### 1. Gene Expression Analysis Using Python
- Compared gene expression levels between cancer and normal samples
- Calculated expression differences using Pandas and NumPy
- Visualized results using simple bar plots
- Interpreted biological significance of results

### 2. Grouped Gene Expression Analysis with Visualization
- Performed grouped analysis of gene expression data by gene and condition
- Used Pandas GroupBy and pivoting to restructure biological data
- Calculated condition-wise expression differences
- Visualized gene expression differences using bar charts
- Demonstrated real-world bioinformatics-style data analysis workflow
