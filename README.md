# Gene Expression Analysis Using Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates a basic gene expression analysis workflow using Python.
Gene expression levels in cancer and normal samples are compared to identify
genes that are potentially overexpressed in cancer.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Google Colab

## Dataset
A simplified gene expression dataset containing expression values
for selected genes in cancer and normal conditions.

## Analysis Steps
- Data creation and loading
- Exploratory data analysis
- Calculation of expression differences
- Identification of highly expressed genes
- Biological interpretation of results

## Key Findings
Genes such as **EGFR** and **MYC** show higher expression levels in cancer samples
compared to normal samples, suggesting potential involvement in cancer-related
biological processes.
